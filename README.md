Hypothesis Testing – Mobile Internet Usage Case Study
📘 Context

ExperienceMyServices claims that the average American spends approximately 144 minutes (or 2.4 hours) per day using the Internet on a mobile device, with a standard deviation of 110 minutes. To evaluate the accuracy of this claim, a sample of 30 individuals was collected from friends and family. The dataset "InternetMobileTime.csv" contains the recorded daily mobile internet usage times (in minutes) for these individuals.
❓ Key Question

Is there sufficient statistical evidence to suggest that the actual average time spent per day on mobile internet usage is different from 144 minutes?

We will use the p-value approach to hypothesis testing at a 5% level of significance (α = 0.05) to answer this question.

📝 Note: It is assumed that the sample is randomly selected, the observations are independent, and the population from which the sample is drawn is normally distributed.
